## 🌟 Overview

**MERN-LMS** is a **full-stack Learning Management System** designed to bring **students, instructors, and administrators** on a single digital platform for learning, teaching, and management.  

Unlike basic course websites, this platform **manages the complete learning cycle** — from **course creation and enrollment** to **content delivery, assignment submission, and progress tracking** — all inside one secure and user-friendly application.  

It is **role-based**:
- **Students** can explore and enroll in courses, learn through structured lessons, and track their progress.
- **Instructors** can design, manage, and monitor courses while engaging directly with enrolled students.
- **Admins** oversee and control the system to ensure smooth functioning and quality content.

This project was built during a **6-week Bootcamp** to simulate a real-world software development environment, making us **internship-ready** with hands-on MERN stack experience.

## 💡 Uniqueness & Key Highlights

1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** – Three distinct roles (Student, Instructor, Admin) with separate dashboards and permissions.
2. **End-to-End Learning Flow** – From signup/login → browsing → enrollment → learning → tracking progress → content management.
3. **Secure Authentication** – JWT-based authentication with protected routes and session handling.
4. **Scalable Structure** – Modular backend with MVC pattern; easily extendable for future features like payments, certificates, etc.
5. **Real-World Approach** – Mimics industry-grade LMS platforms like Udemy or Coursera, but simplified for educational projects.
6. **Team Collaboration** – Developed by a team of 6, dividing work into frontend, backend, database, and testing — following Git & GitHub collaboration best practices.
7. **User Experience Focused** – Clean UI for easy navigation with responsive design principles.
